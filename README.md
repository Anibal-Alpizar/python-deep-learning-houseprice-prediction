# Python Deep Learning House Price prediction

This project implements a House Price prediction using deep learning techniques in Python with TensorFlow. The model utilizes a dense layer with one unit to perform the temperature House Price prediction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.

2. Ensure that you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

``pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib``


3. Run the `main.py` script to train the deep learning model and make House Price prediction.

## Usage

The `main.py` script contains the main code of the project. When executed, the model will be trained using a predefined set of meters and price data. Subsequently, a plot of the loss magnitude during training will be displayed.

After training, the deep learning model can be used to make conversion predictions by providing input values in price.
